Welcome to the ExpenseBot. This bot helps you manage and track your daily expenses. You can add new expenses or get an overview or list for any month or category.


*Adding a new expense*
The following examples will show you various ways to add a new expense.
1. \`1.99 Lunch #food\` or
2. \`${cfg.COMMANDS.NEW} 1.99 Lunch #food\` will add an expense of _1.99_ (whichever your currency is, that doesn't matter) with the description _Lunch_ to the category _#food_.

You can simply leave out the category (which is always defined by a hash sign) - this is just for you to have a clearer overview and separation later.

*Please note:* You can also type _negative_ number if you had an income or want to compensate an expense.


*Getting your expenses*
To get an overview of your current financial situation you can do the following:
1. \`${cfg.COMMANDS.GET}\` lets you choose a month.
2. \`${cfg.COMMANDS.GET} April\` or simply \`April\` - the total amount of the expenses in April. Of course this works with any other month.
3. \`${cfg.COMMANDS.GET} #food\` or simply \`#food\` - the total amount of expenses in the _#food_ category in the current month.
4. \`${cfg.COMMANDS.GET} #food April\` or simply \`#food April\` - the total amount of expenses in the _#food_ category in April
5. The same works for weekdays instead of months, e.g. \`Monday\`

*Listing your expenses*
To get an overview of your current financial situation you can do the following:
1. \`${cfg.COMMANDS.LIST} April\` - all expenses in April. Of course this works with any other month.
2. \`${cfg.COMMANDS.LIST} #food\` - all expenses in the _#food_ category in the current month.
3. \`${cfg.COMMANDS.LIST} #food April\` - all expenses in the _#food_ category in April
4. The same works for weekdays instead of months, e.g. \`Monday\`

*Exporting your expenses*
You can export your expenses to a CSV file to archive them or do further analyses in Excel or so. To create new export do:
1. \`${cfg.COMMANDS.EXPORT} April\` - export all expeses from April.

*Resetting your expenses*
To reset (i.e. delete) all your expenses for a given month or category, you can do the following:
1. \`${cfg.COMMANDS.RESET} April\` - delete all expenses in April. Of course this works with any other month.
2. \`${cfg.COMMANDS.RESET} #food\` - delete all expenses in the _#food_ category in the current month.
3. \`${cfg.COMMANDS.RESET} #food April\` - delete all expenses in the _#food_ category in April
4. The same works for weekdays instead of months, e.g. \`Monday\`
